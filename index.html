            <h2>My personal take on my favorite show, The Sopranos.</h2>

            <div>

                <p>The television shows the Sopranos first debuted in 1998, the first scene was very uneventful and would set the stage for the next 5 seasons. Before the Sopranos subjects such as mental health and various other social problems relating to that weren’t shown on television. The first scene was Tony your regular middle-aged dad (Mob Boss) seeing a clinical psychiatrist, and discussing the daily stress imposed from his regular family and in turn, his mob family. Before the Sopranos aired, a scene or subject like this had never been explored, with our main character being an everyday joe with a twist, we as the audience could relate with how he dealt with his mental health issues, and the everyday problems that caused it. In this paper we will explore Tony Sopranos mental illness and the diagnosis given to him by Dr. Melfi his psychiatrist and see how well it translates into the real world.</p>

                <p>Tony Soprano is diagnosed very early on with anit-social-personality disorder (ADP). This is the condition that his psychiatrist Dr. Melfi treats through the course of the show, providing Tony with a skewed moral compass, as he feels guilt when going against the morals presented by Melfi. We can definitely see that Tony has this disorder through many of his actions throughout the show. Being a leader of the Mob and a powerful criminal organization, this calls upon traits that ADP has. Tony for example is shown time and time again, that he cares very little for the emotions of others. Towards the end of the series Tony is constantly berating his nephew over his alcohol and drug addiction, calling him a failure, and telling him he is a disgrace. But once his nephew is Sober, he continues to berate him for not having a drink or a hit of something at social gatherings. He tells his nephew that he has created a social crutch using excuses as his alcoholic mother and drug addicted father (Schwartz, 2020). </p>
                
                <p>This is very hypocritical since Tony himself uses one of these “crutches” as he constantly blames the state of his mental well being and panic attacks on his mother, who never loved him and the violent mafia environment that he grew up in. Tony shows that he does not mind manipulating others for his personal gain or just to for his own amusement, such as high functioning sociopaths, that aren’t necessarily killers but have no concern for the emotions of others and only care for their own well being and benefit, as is the case, Tony finds this constant beratement of his nephew amusing and a way to keep him in line. He also has no sense of morality, taking as he please with no concern for others. A good example of this is when Tony visits his old neighborhood in Newark and finds it run down and desolate with many African Americans. He later bankrolls a scheme to buy up those houses with Federal Aid claiming to be a nonprofit and convert them to low-income housing. Using that front he pockets the money and gloats to his family that the “blacks” have ruined the neighborhood, while he himself has systemically displaced the impoverished minorities for financial gain. He then takes the money to finance a small real estate project that his wife is building, with very poor build quality, a task he sees as something noble, saying she is building a beautiful home for a potential family. This further underlines his Hypocrisy and lack of morals, since his real estate scam has destroyed the families of countless minorities, so his wife can have an expensive little million dollar real estate project, that is not structurally sound and a potential danger for anyone that moves in. Tony only cares about things or people that directly benefit him, he wants to keep his wife because that gives him pleasure, even at the cost of destroying the futures of countless families.</p>
                
                <p>Tony has a very difficult and complicated relationship with Dr. Mlefi his psychiatrist. Not only is Melfi his physician but a love interest as well, as many times in the show, Tony tries to sexually assault her on many occasions. Many would call her unprofessional for continuing her work with him. But many Psychiatrists disagree, saying very few could treat Tony well as Melfi did during the course of the show. The difficulty of treating someone with ADP is that they have no moral conscience and his disregard for other people, in short, they do as the please, if it doesn’t affect them. In real life treating Tony would be a nightmare, as his constant sexual advances would break standard medical ethics. And with Tonys criminal background, and his illegal doings and experiences coming up in conversation, you as the psychiatrist would be legally bound to report these incidents if anyone was in direct harm or harmed already. This would also limit Tonys willingness to open up and further discuss his problems which would only make your job more difficult (Schwartz, 2020).</p>
                
                <p>Melfi is an excellent psychiatrist, although she is extremely unorthodox. She keeps Tony’s aggression to a minimum since she’s an attractive woman who he desires, hurting her would cause him harm because he wants her sexually, so his bursts of rage and proneness to anger would be kept low. Her strengths lie in the fact that Tony cannot manipulate or coerce her into submission, which is very hard since Tony is a very powerful and wealthy man, and Melfi on many occasions has stated that he is sexual attractive and handsome. But she keeps herself composed and professional so she can properly treat him.</p>
                
                <p>One of the big problems Tony has during the whole course of the series is his relationship with his mother. His mother Livia is a constant source of distress and depression in his life. She constantly puts her son down and everyone around her.</p>
                
                <p>She is never content and cannot seems to find happiness in whatever situation she is in (Tohelenbackagain, 2016). Ever since Tony was a child, she put him and his other siblings through the same torture. Being overbearing and a negative influence from the start. The fact that she was so controlling, manipulative, and hateful towards her children contributed to Tonys ADP. There have been many studies and links found between overbearing mothers that don’t provide the maternal care and love that normal one does (Samuels, 2002). From the start of the series Tony is conflicted about his mother since he genuinely tries to love her, but only ends up developing more and more hate as the series progresses. Tony tries many times to be a good son for her, offering to have him stay and live with them in his house, to visiting her daily when she lived alone, to bringing her pastries at her nursery home. Livia never ceases to undermine and put Tony down when she gets the chance, whether it be to his friends, his family, or even directly to his children. Tony suffers immensely as his female figure in his life is so overbearing, he feels emasculated. He even confides to Melfi that he had a dream were his Penis falls off and is taken by a bird, directly after a confrontation with his mother. Towards the end of the series Tony becomes exactly what he feared, he came as hateful as his mother incapable of loving and feeling happy.</p>
                
                <p>The story of Tony Soprano and his struggle with ADP in a clinical setting is a fascinating way of presenting this disorder in an entertaining yet informational way, as many scholars have confirmed the TV diagnosis. It was landmark showing mental disorders realistically and in a relatable context through Tonys struggle with his mother, and his families, his normal one, and his mob one. These are connections we can all relate too, our parental figures, our family life, our professional life, and how it all bleeds in together. Hopefully a character like Tony Soprano only exists on Television on a TV show and not in real life, no matter how accurate the depiction is.</p>
